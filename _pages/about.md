I am a developer of artificial intelligence and robotics, using music and creativity as a medium to program better interactions, understandings and models. I am currently a Research Fellow at Macquarie University, developing new robotic musicians.

I completed a PhD in Music Technology (minor in Human Computer Interaction), at the Georgia Institute of Technology, graduating in 2021. My research was conducted in the Robotic Musicianship Lab with Gil Weinberg. Much of my PhD work was based on a $800,000 NSF-National Robotics Initiative grant I received to develop forms of emotional musical prosody to increase trust in group human-robot collaboration. Before Georgia Tech I worked as a freelance music technologist, composer and performer. I completed my Masters at the University of California, Irvine, in Integrated Composition, Improvisation and Technology. I have composed and orchestrated many video games, films and ads including Fast Four featuring Roger Federer and worked for 15 years as a professional saxophonist, clarinetist and flutist.
