I am a developer of artificial intelligence and robotics, using music and creativity as a medium to program better interactions, understandings and models. I'm currently completing a PhD in Music Technology (minor in Human Computer Interaction), at the Georgia Institute of Technology, with a graduation goal of December 2021. My research is conducted in the Robotic Musicianship Lab with Gil Weinberg.

Before Georgia Tech I worked as a freelance music technologist, composer and performer. I completed my Masters at the University of California, Irvine, in Integrated Composition, Improvisation and Technology. I have composed and orchestrated many video games, films and ads including Fast Four featuring Roger Federer and worked for 15 years as a professional saxophonist, clarinetist and flutist. Much of my current work is based on a $700,000 NSF-National Robotics Initiative grant I recently received to develop forms of emotional musical prosody to increase trust in group human-robot collaboration.
