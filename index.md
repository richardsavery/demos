Developer of artificial intelligence and robotics, using music and creativity as a medium to program better interactions, understandings and models. I'm currently in my 3rd year of a PhD in Music Technology with a minor in Human Computer Interaction, at the Georgia Institute of Technology, working in the Robotic Musicianship Lab with Gil Weinberg.

This page includes my recent projects, completed from 2017 onwards. For archived projects visit www.richardsavery.com

# Shimi and Prosody

My work with Shimi focused on generating a new non-speech voice focused on developing better human-robot interaction. This was done using prosodic audio generated through deep learning on an embedded Nvidia Jetson TX2. I was able to show that using this new voice created a more trustworthy version of Shimi than using a human voice.

This worked then developed into an accepted $669,000, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1925178&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">NSF-NRI Grant proposal</a> I wrote as the primary author with my advisor Gil Weinberg in 2019.

# Shimon
Shimon is a robotic marimba player I have been working with since 2017. I have focused on real-time deep learning improvisation and computer generated compositions. We have toured Denmark, Netherlands, Canary Islands.

I am currently working on Shimon 2.0, featuring Shimon singing computer generated lyrics and rapping in real-time interactions (due for release in March 2020 on the BBC).
