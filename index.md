# Shimi and Prosody
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](/MzI0NDE0NA-1.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDAmApNw5wo)
My work with Shimi focused on generating a new non-speech voice. This was done using deep learning on an embedded Nvidia Jetson TX2. I was also able to show that using this new voice created a more trustworthy version of Shimi than using a human voice. 

This worked then developed into an accepted $669,000, [NSF-NRI Grant proposal](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1925178&HistoricalAwards=false) I worked on as the primary author with my advisor Gil Weinberg in 2019.
