Developer of artificial intelligence and robotics, using music and creativity as a medium to program better interactions, understandings and models. I'm currently in my 3rd year of a PhD in Music Technology at the Georgia Institute of Technology, working in the Robotic Musicianship Lab with Gil Weinberg.

# Shimi and Prosody

My work with Shimi focused on generating a new non-speech voice focused on developing better human-robot interaction. This was done using prosodic audio generated through deep learning on an embedded Nvidia Jetson TX2. I was able to show that using this new voice created a more trustworthy version of Shimi than using a human voice.

This worked then developed into an accepted $669,000, [NSF-NRI Grant proposal](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1925178&HistoricalAwards=false) I wrote as the primary author with my advisor Gil Weinberg in 2019.
