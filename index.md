I am a developer of artificial intelligence and robotics, using music and creativity as a medium to program better interactions, understandings and models. I'm currently in my 3rd year of a PhD in Music Technology (minor in Human Computer Interaction), at the Georgia Institute of Technology, working in the Robotic Musicianship Lab with Gil Weinberg.

# Shimi and Prosody

My work with Shimi focuses on generating a new non-speech voice while avoiding uncanny valley and developing better human-robot interaction. This was done using prosodic audio generated through deep learning on an embedded Nvidia Jetson TX2. I was able to show that using this new voice created a more trustworthy version of Shimi than using a human voice. 


In 2019 I was the primary author with my advisor Gil Weinberg for an awarded $669,000, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1925178&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">NSF-NRI Grant proposal</a> "Creating Trust Between Groups of Humans and Robots Using a Novel Music Driven Robotic Emotion Generator" to continue this work.

# Shimon
Shimon is a robotic marimba player I have been working with since 2017. I have focus on real-time deep learning improvisation and computer generated compositions. A recent highlight included an hour long performance in Aarhus, Denmark combining CNN's for improvisation, visuals and a jazz orchestra. This concert was awarded the Jazz Denmark Prize for "the most innovative and creative concert experience of the year".


#### Deep Learning Based Composition

I am currently working on Shimon 2.0, featuring Shimon singing computer generated lyrics and rapping in real-time interactions (due for release in March 2020 on the BBC).

# Deep Score and Shimon the Film Composer

![Shimon Robot Watching Film](/promo.shimon.watching.jpg)

This project combines existing computer vision techniques to develop an understanding of a films narrative arc, based on main characters and their emotions. This arc is combined with visually analyzed director aesthetic choices including pacing and levels of movement. These parameters are then used to generate a full score for short films.

### Harriet Padberg
Harriet Padberg wrote Computer-Composed Canon and Free Fugue as part of her 1964 dissertation in Mathematics and Music at Saint Louis University. This program is one of the earliest examples of text-to-music software and algorithmic composition, which are areas of great interest in the present-day field of music technology, yet has largely been ignored. We recreated the work and shared it with multiple composers.
