I am a developer of artificial intelligence and robotics, using music and creativity as a medium to program better interactions, understandings and models. Currently in my 3rd year of a PhD in Music Technology (minor in Human Computer Interaction), at the Georgia Institute of Technology, working in the Robotic Musicianship Lab with Gil Weinberg.

# Shimi and Prosody

My work with Shimi focuses on generating a new non-speech voice while avoiding uncanny valley and developing better human-robot interaction. This was done using prosodic audio generated through deep learning on an embedded Nvidia Jetson TX2. I was able to show that using this new voice created a more trustworthy version of Shimi than using a human voice. 


This worked then developed into an accepted $669,000, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1925178&HistoricalAwards=false" target="_blank">NSF-NRI Grant proposal</a> I wrote as the primary author with my advisor Gil Weinberg in 2019.

# Shimon
Shimon is a robotic marimba player I have been working with since 2017. I have focused on real-time deep learning improvisation and computer generated compositions. A recent highlight included an hour long performance in Aarhus, Denmark combining CNN's for improvisation, visuals and a jazz orchestra. This concert was awarded the Jazz Denmark Prize for "the most innovative and creative concert experience of the year".


#### Deep Learning Based Composition

I am currently working on Shimon 2.0, featuring Shimon singing computer generated lyrics and rapping in real-time interactions (due for release in March 2020 on the BBC).

# Deep Score and Shimon the Film Composer

Composing for a film requires developing an understanding of the film, its characters and the film aesthetic choices made by the director. We propose using existing visual analysis systems as a core technology for film music generation. We extract film features including main characters and their emotions to develop a computer understanding of the film's narrative arc. This arc is combined with visually analyzed director aesthetic choices including pacing and levels of movement. Two systems are presented, the first using a robotic film composer and marimbist to generate film scores in real-time performance. The second software-based system builds on the results from the robot film composer to create narrative driven film scores.

### Harriet Padberg
Harriet Padberg wrote Computer-Composed Canon and Free Fugue as part of her 1964 dissertation in Mathematics and Music at Saint Louis University. This program is one of the earliest examples of text-to-music software and algorithmic composition, which are areas of great interest in the present-day field of music technology, yet has largely been ignored. We recreated the work and ..
