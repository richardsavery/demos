In Novemeber 2023, new actuated frame drums were combined with a UR3 robotic arm playing a Caxixi percussion instrument. In collaboration with AESOP, the installation was in their Pitt St, Sydney storefront for three weeks. 

The system reacted in realtime to the instore music system, playing along to any music that was played through their speakers. 

The robot arm was programmed by Dr Fred Sukkar (technical details on the arm [here](https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/173900)).
