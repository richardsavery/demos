##### MFA Capstone Concert

Artificial Improvisers features computer programs acting as interactive collaborators, improvising and composing music in real time with human performers. These computers aim to be truly interactive, through active listening and engagement with a human musician. Each program aims to remain autonomous and capable of producing its own music without a human performer. The computer moves through a variety of roles in each piece, at times acting as an equal improviser, other times as a composer/conductor, and other times taking a leading role. The full playlist of the concert is below.
