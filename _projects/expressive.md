## Sound Happening
Sound Happening is an interactive installation in which participants can collaboratively create music together by moving colorful balls around a defined interaction space. A webcam tracks the location and the color of the balls and generates music according to those parameters. I worked as the lead of this project, rewriting the code and developing new sound design. After several installations on campus at Georgia Tech we presented the work at the ACC Creativity & Innovation Festival at the Smithsonian, Washington D.C.

## EarSketch
EarSketch is a free educational programming environment. Its core purpose is to teach coding in two widely used languages, Python and JavaScript, through music composing and remixing. I worked on EarSketch in 2018, improving and rewriting the curriculm that is used by students. I also helped develop a new curriculum for high schoolteachers to use Earsketch in the classroom, while matching Georgia, USA state requirements. I then helped teach this curriculum over summer sessions to teachers around Atlanta.

## Groove Machine
Groove Machine is a responsive tabletop application with a tangible user interface designed for the museum space. The intention is to teach basic computer programming concepts to middle school and high school students (ages 9-16 years old) using physical blocks that work as snippets of code. TuneTable applies computational elements like functions, parameters, and nested loops. My work in Groove Machine involved developing prototype software for it's implementation and developing the music samples used. While I worked on the project it was presented for a week in the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.
