<!-- ###### About: -->
In January 2022 I started as a [Macquarie University Research Fellow](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-funding-and-grant-opportunities/fellowship-and-grant-opportunities/internal_funding/mq-research-fellowships), with the goal of developing new robotic musicians, continuing my research exploring AI, creativity, music and robotics.

My primary focus is the development of Keirzo, a new robot for rapping and drumming. You can see all the details on Keirzo at the robot's website [https://www.keirzo.com](https://www.keirzo.com) or check out some demos below. 


## Freestyle Rap Exchange

Keirzo is able to rap for any length of time with humans of any musical skill level, from professional rappers to non-musicians. Responding back to input phrases, rap, or just single words, Keirzo produces an original rap in real-time along with a groove. Check out the demo below.

## Jazz Performance
Keirzo is able to drum along with a human ensemble, using an input from a microphone to accompany. The video below shows Keirzo performing at the Roundtable with the Hon. Anoulack Chanthivong in December 2023. Featuring [Mary Rapp](https://maryrapp.com.au/) on bass and [Richard Savery](www.richardsavery.com) on saxophone.
