<!-- ###### About: -->
In January 2022 I started as a [Macquarie University Research Fellow](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-funding-and-grant-opportunities/fellowship-and-grant-opportunities/internal_funding/mq-research-fellowships), with the goal of developing new robotic musicians, continuing my research exploring AI, creativity, music and robotics.

My primary focus is the development of Keirzo, a new robot for rapping and drumming. You can see all the details on Keirzo at the robot's website [https//www.keirzo.com](https//www.keirzo.com) or check out some demos below. 


## Freestyle Rap Exchange

Keirzo is able to rap for any length of time with humans of any musical skill level, from professional rappers to non-musicians. Responding back to input phrases, rap, or just single words, Keirzo produces an original rap in real-time along with a groove. Check out the demo below.

## 60 Second Composition
One of Keirzo's current features is to generate a 1 minute composition - a bass line, chords, harmony lines and lyrics - and then play and rap the new composition. 

A human inputs three words, in the video below it was ‘music’, 'drums' and ‘future’. Audio files are then given to the musicians (or played back through speakers).
