<!-- ###### About: -->
In January 2022 I started as a [Macquarie University Research Fellow](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-funding-and-grant-opportunities/fellowship-and-grant-opportunities/internal_funding/mq-research-fellowships), with the goal of developing new robotic musicians, continuing my research exploring AI, creativity, music and robotics.

My 3 year research plan consists of 4 primary goals:

 1. The development of a new hardware and software robotic musicianship platform, informed by a systematic study of human-robot interaction in mixed musical ensembles.
 2. New understandings through practice-based research of musical collaboration between humans and robots.
 3. New computing techniques and best knowledge of best practices to facilitate domain-expert humans (e.g. professional musicians) and robotic collaborators.
 4. The creation of broad technical and conceptual guidelines for the incorporation of AI and robotics in society

In the first half of 2022 I expect to complete the development of a new interactive robotic drummer.
