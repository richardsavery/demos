###### About:
When I joined the robotic musicianship lab at Georgia Tech, Shimon the Robot had been performing for eight years. One area that had never been explored was lyrics and Shimon as a singer song writer. In 2020 we released the album Shimon Sings. I developed the lyrical generator and used many of my musical generation systems to create musical tracks for the album.
