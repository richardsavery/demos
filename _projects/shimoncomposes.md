###### About:
Shimon's development as a film composer came out of a collaboration with [Janet Biggs](http://www.jbiggs.com/) in 2017, out of her concept of a film scored by a robot. This project uses many common deep learning computer vision techniques to develop an understanding of a films narrative arc, based on main characters, their emotions and object detection. This arc is combined with visually derived director aesthetic choices including pacing and levels of movement. These parameters are then used to generate a full score for short films, played by Shimon.

### Press and Reviews
The premere of the film took place at the [Museos de Tenerife in the Canary Islands](https://www.museosdetenerife.org/museos-de-tenerife/editorial/686)

##### DeepScore
After developing Shimon the Film Composer I turned the system into a software only automatic composer, which allowed human input. You can see and hear a [System Demo here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/czavyw1hkigejcc/Interfacedemolong.mp4?dl=0)

*Abstract:*  Composing for a film requires developing an understanding
of the film, its characters and the film aesthetic choices made by the
director. We propose using existing visual analysis systems as a core
technology for film music generation. We extract film features including
main characters and their emotions to develop a computer understanding of the filmâ€™s narrative arc. This arc is combined with visually analyzed director aesthetic choices including pacing and levels of movement.
Two systems are presented, the first using a robotic film composer and
marimbist to generate film scores in real-time performance. The second
software-based system builds on the results from the robot film composer
to create narrative driven film scores.
