Shimon is a robotic marimba player I have been working with since 2017. I have focus on real-time deep learning improvisation and computer generated compositions. A recent highlight included an hour long performance in Aarhus, Denmark combining CNN's for improvisation, visuals and a jazz orchestra. This concert was awarded the Jazz Denmark Prize for "the most innovative and creative concert experience of the year".


#### Deep Learning Based Composition

I am currently working on Shimon 2.0, featuring Shimon singing computer generated lyrics and rapping in real-time interactions (due for release in March 2020 on the BBC).

This project combines existing computer vision techniques to develop an understanding of a films narrative arc, based on main characters and their emotions. This arc is combined with visually analyzed director aesthetic choices including pacing and levels of movement. These parameters are then used to generate a full score for short films.
