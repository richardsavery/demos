###### About:
I've worked with Shimon on multiple deep learning and generative music systems. These have been used in many concerts and performances worldwide. The recent highlight featured here include automatic film scoring with a premiere in Canary Islands, an hour long performance with the Aarhus Jazz Orchestra which won the "Jazz Denmark Prize" (Danish Grammy's), and a live broadcast in the Netherlands.


### Automatic Film Scoring
##### Shimon the Film Composer
Shimon's development as a film composer came out of a collaboration with Janet Biggs,This project combines existing computer vision techniques to develop an understanding of a films narrative arc, based on main characters and their emotions. This arc is combined with visually analyzed director aesthetic choices including pacing and levels of movement. These parameters are then used to generate a full score for short films, played by Shimon.



Also led to the other film, that Shimon composer for Jason Barnes.
