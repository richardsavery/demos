Sonification is the process of turning data into sound. I've worked on multiple sonification projects, including robot gesture sonification, soccer sonification and EEG sonification.

## Robot Sonification
In this work we develop a divergent approach to robotic sonification with the goal of improving the quality and safety of human-robot interactions. Sonification has been underutilized in robotics, and has broad potential to convey robotic movement and intentions to users without requiring visual engagement. We designed and evaluated six different sonifications of movements for a robot with four degrees of freedom.

## Soccer Sonification
This project was developed with the [Georgia Tech Sonification Lab, led by Bruce Walker.](http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/~walkerb/) It focused on using data provided by soccer clubs of player and ball movement with the purpose of providing extra information and entertainment to a general audience.

## EEG Sonification
This project mapped alpha, beta, theta and delta from a 32 channel EEG signal to various generative music processes.
